# calculator-

A very simple calculator with specific functions that were requested by a friend of mine for his job. 
Apperently it was a recurring thing to want to calculate the final price of a product for a costumer by adding a specific precentege of profit, the cost of shipping
and also with or without tax (moms). So these were the functions that were implemented in python using tkinter (which i was somewhat familiar with) for a simple GUI. 

A simple project that was done in less than 1 hour
